# 2001_The_Game

Rules:
Each player starts with a score of 0 points.
On their turn, a player rolls 2 dice (standard six-sided dice).
The number rolled is added to the player's total score.
Starting from the second turn:
If a player rolls a 7, they divide their total score by 7, discarding any remainder.
If they roll an 11, they multiply their current score by 11.
The player who first reaches 2001 points wins.
